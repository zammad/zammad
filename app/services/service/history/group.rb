# Create a list of grouped history records by given interval and issuer for a
# given object.
#
# An entry in the list contains the following information:
# - created_at: The timestamp when the group was created.
# - records:    The records that were grouped by the given interval.
#
# The created_at timestamp is the start of the interval rounded to seconds.
#
# A record contains the following information:
# - issuer: The issuer who created the record.
# - events: The events triggered by the issuer.
#
# For the events, see Service::History::List. (The issuer is removed in the
# event, to avoid redundancy.)
#
# Example:
# Service::History::Group.new(current_user:).execute(object: ticket)
# # => [
# #      {
# #        created_at: ActiveRecord::DateTime,
# #        records:    [
# #          {
# #            issuer: User,
# #            events: [
# #              {
# #                created_at: ActiveRecord::DateTime,
# #                action:     'created',
# #                object:     Ticket,
# #                attribute:  nil,
# #                changes:    { from: nil, to: nil }
# #              },
# #            ]
# #          }
# #        ]
# #      }
