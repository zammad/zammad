# Create a list of history events for a given object.
#
# An entry in the list contains the following information:
# - created_at: The timestamp when the event was created.
# - issuer:     The issuer who created the event.
# - action:     The type of the event.
# - object:     The object the event is related to.
# - attribute:  The attribute of the object that was changed.
# - changes:    The changes that were made to the attribute.
#
# The object and issuer attributes contain a pseudo object if the related
# object doesn't exist anymore with the following information:
# - klass: The name of the object's class.
# - info: Additional information about the object.
#
# Example:
#
#  Service::History::List.new(current_user:).execute(object: ticket)
#  # => [
#  #      {
#  #        created_at: ActiveRecord::DateTime,
