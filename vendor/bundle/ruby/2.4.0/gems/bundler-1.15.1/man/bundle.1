.
.SH "BUNDLER TRAMPOLINING"
Bundler includes a feature called trampolining, designed to allow a single developer to work on multiple projects, each on different Bundler versions\. The trampoline will infer the correct version of Bundler to use for each project and load that version instead of the version directly invoked (which is almost always the newest version installed locally)\.
.
.P
Bundler by default will use the Bundler version in the current directory to determine the version to trampoline to, reading from the \fBBUNDLED WITH\fR section\. However, if the \fBBUNDLER_VERSION\fR environment variable is set, that version will override the lockfile inference and can be used in directories without a lockfile\.
.
.P
Until the target version is Bundler 2 or later, \fBBUNDLE_TRAMPOLINE_FORCE\fR must be set for the trampoline to be used\. Additionally, \fBBUNDLE_TRAMPOLINE_DISABLE\fR can be set to completely disable the trampoline\.
.
.SH "OBSOLETE"
These commands are obsolete and should no longer be used
