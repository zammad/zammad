== Description

This library is converted from Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module of Perl.
http://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-2.38/

Original description is below:

    The Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module can be used to create a cross-
    platform Excel binary file. Multiple worksheets can be added to a
    workbook and formatting can be applied to cells. Text, numbers,
    formulas, hyperlinks, images and charts can be written to the cells.

    TThe Excel file produced by this module is compatible with 97,
    2000, 2002, 2003 and 2007.

    The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX and
    Macintosh platforms. Generated files are also compatible with the
    spreadsheet applications Gnumeric and OpenOffice.org.

    This module cannot be used to read an Excel file.

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'writeexcel'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install writeexcel

== Usage

See Reference http://writeexcel.web.fc2.com/ .
You must save source file in UTF8, and run ruby with -Ku option or set $KCODE='u' in Ruby 1.8.

Example Code:

    require 'writeexcel'

    # Create a new Excel Workbook
    workbook = WriteExcel.new('ruby.xls')

    # Add worksheet(s)
    worksheet  = workbook.add_worksheet
    worksheet2 = workbook.add_worksheet

    # Add and define a format
    format = workbook.add_format
    format.set_bold
    format.set_color('red')
    format.set_align('right')

    # write a formatted and unformatted string.
    worksheet.write(1, 1, 'Hi Excel.', format)  # cell B2
    worksheet.write(2, 1, 'Hi Excel.')          # cell B3

    # write a number and formula using A1 notation
    worksheet.write('B4', 3.14159)
    worksheet.write('B5', '=SIN(B4/4)')

    # write to file
    workbook.close

== Difference with Perl module

* WriteExcel.new()
  * accept default format parameter such as new('foo.xls', :font => 'Roman', :size => 12)
* Unary minus is supported, but it will be stored as '-1*'. ex) '=-1' -> '=-1*1', '=-SIN(PI()/2)' => '=-1*SIN(PI()/2)'
* Worksheet.write(row, col, token, format)
  * if token.kind_of?(Numeric) then call write_number, if token.kind_of?(String) then not call write_number().
* Worksheet.keep_leading_zeros()
  * ignore. if write 0001, use string such as write(1,2, '0001')
* and ......
