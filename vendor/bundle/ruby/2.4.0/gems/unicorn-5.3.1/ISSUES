mailto:unicorn-public@bogomips.org is the best place to report bugs,
submit patches and/or obtain support after you have searched the
{email archives}[https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/] and
{documentation}[https://bogomips.org/unicorn/].

* No subscription will ever be required to email us
* Cc: all participants in a thread or commit, as subscription is optional
* Do not {top post}[http://catb.org/jargon/html/T/top-post.html] in replies
* Quote as little as possible of the message you're replying to
* Do not send HTML mail or images,
  they hurt reader privacy and will be flagged as spam
* Anonymous and pseudonymous messages will ALWAYS be welcome
* The email submission port (587) is enabled on the bogomips.org MX:
  https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/20141004232241.GA23908@dcvr.yhbt.net/t/

If your issue is of a sensitive nature or you're just shy in public,
use anonymity tools such as Tor or Mixmaster; and rely on the public
mail archives for responses.  Be sure to scrub sensitive log messages
and such.

If you don't get a response within a few days, we may have forgotten
about it so feel free to ask again.

== Bugs in related projects

unicorn is sometimes affected by bugs in its dependencies.  Bugs
triggered by unicorn in mainline Ruby, rack, GNU C library (glibc),
or the Linux kernel will be reported upstream and fixed.

For bugs in Ruby itself, we may forward bugs to
https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ and discuss+fix them on the ruby-core
list at mailto:ruby-core@ruby-lang.org
Subscription to post is required to ruby-core, unfortunately:
mailto:ruby-core-request@ruby-lang.org?subject=subscribe

For uncommon bugs in Rack, we may forward bugs to
mailto:rack-devel@googlegroups.com and discuss there.
Subscription (without any web UI or Google account) is possible via:
mailto:rack-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com
Note: not everyone can use the proprietary bug tracker used by Rack,
but their mailing list remains operational.

Uncommon bugs we encounter in the Linux kernel should be Cc:-ed to the
Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) at mailto:linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
and subsystem maintainers such as mailto:netdev@vger.kernel.org
(for networking issues).  It is expected practice to Cc: anybody
involved with any problematic commits (including those in the
Signed-off-by: and other trailer lines).  No subscription is necessary,
and the our mailing list follows the same conventions as LKML for
interopability.  There is a kernel.org Bugzilla instance, but it is
ignored by most developers.

Likewise for any rare glibc bugs we might encounter, we should Cc:
mailto:libc-alpha@sourceware.org
Keep in mind glibc upstream does use Bugzilla for tracking bugs:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/

== Submitting Patches

See the HACKING document (and additionally, the
{SubmittingPatches}[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches]
document distributed with git) on guidelines for patch submission.

Mailing list subscription is optional, so Cc: all participants.

You can follow along via NNTP (read-only):

	nntp://news.public-inbox.org/inbox.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn
	nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn.general

Or Atom feeds:

	https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/new.atom
	http://ou63pmih66umazou.onion/unicorn-public/new.atom

	The HTML archives at https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/
	also has links to per-thread Atom feeds and downloadable
	mboxes.

You may optionally subscribe via plain-text email:

	mailto:unicorn-public+subscribe@bogomips.org
	(and confirming the auto-reply)

Just keep in mind we suck at delivering email, so using NNTP,
or Atom feeds might be a better bet...
