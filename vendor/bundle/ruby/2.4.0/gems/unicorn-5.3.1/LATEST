=== unicorn 5.3.0 / 2017-04-01 08:03 UTC

  A couple of portability fixes from Dylan Thacker-Smith and
  Jeremy Evans since 5.3.0.pre1 over a week ago, but this looks
  ready for a stable release, today.

  When I started this over 8 years ago, I wondered if this would
  just end up being an April Fools' joke.  Guess not.  I guess I
  somehow tricked people into using a terribly marketed web server
  that cannot talk directly to untrusted clients :x  Anyways,
  unicorn won't be able to handle slow clients 8 years from now,
  either, or 80 years from now.  And I vow never to learn to use
  new-fangled things like epoll, kqueue, or threads :P

  Anyways, this is a largish release with several new features,
  and no backwards incompatibilities.

  Simon Eskildsen contributed heavily using TCP_INFO under Linux
  to implement the (now 5 year old) check_client_connection feature:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-check_client_connection
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:check_client_connection&d:..20170401&x=t

  This also led to FreeBSD and OpenBSD portability improvements in
  one of our dependencies, raindrops:

     https://bogomips.org/raindrops-public/20170323024829.GA5190@dcvr/T/#u

  Jeremy Evans contributed several new features.  First he
  implemented after_worker_exit to aid debugging:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-after_worker_exit
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:after_worker_exit&d:..20170401&x=t#t

  And then security-related features to isolate workers.  Workers
  may now chroot to drop access to the master filesystem, and the
  new after_worker_ready configuration hook now exists to aid with
  chroot support in workers:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-after_worker_ready
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Worker.html#method-i-user
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:after_worker_ready&d:..20170401&x=t#t
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:chroot&d:..20170401&x=t#t

  Additionally, workers may run in a completely different VM space
  (nullifying preload_app and any CoW savings) with the new
  worker_exec option:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-worker_exec
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:worker_exec&d:..20170401&x=t#t

  There are also several improvements to FreeBSD and OpenBSD
  support with the addition of these features.
