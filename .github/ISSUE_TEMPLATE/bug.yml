        Hi there - thanks for filing an issue. Please ensure the following things before creating an issue - thank you! 🤓

        🛑 Please post the following on our [community board](https://community.zammad.org/) rather than filing an issue:

        👉 Feature Requests
        👉 Development Questions
        👉 Technical Questions (assistance for non paid / community)

        If you think you hit a bug, please continue:

        👉 Search existing issues and the CHANGELOG.md for your issue - there might be a solution already.
        👉 Make sure to use the latest version of Zammad.
        👉 Add the `log/production.log` file from your system. Attention: Make sure that it does not contain confidential data!
        👉 Please describe the issue in English.

        Note: We always do our best. Unfortunately, sometimes there are too many requests and we can't handle everything at once. If you want to prioritize/escalate your issue, you can do so by means of [a support contract](https://zammad.com/pricing#selfhosted).
